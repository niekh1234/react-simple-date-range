# Introduction

**React simple date range** provides an easy solution for integrating `DatePicker` and `DateRange` components.

## üí£ Features

‚úçÔ∏è **Fully customizable** date cells and colors.

‚ö°Ô∏è It's **fast**, using a clever approach to reduce re-renders.

üáπ React Simple Date Picker is written in **TypeScript** so provides full typing out of the box.

üìï Integrates seamlessly with every form library.

## The 'why'

While browsing the internet trying to find a react date range component that fit my needs I was out of luck. I needed a date range picker for my project that required different colors for different types of disabled ranges. With a popular option such as `react-date-range` I was able to accomplish most of my needs. In fact, I would highly recommend using `react-date-range` as it proved to be a very good library. But my requirements required more out of the component than I thought it was capable of. I needed something custom, using a custom color scheme and the ability to customize a `cell` depending on some input I gave the picker.

## Roadmap

- `DatePicker` and `DateRange` hooks, provided full control over the UI without having to worry about the logic.
- More customizability, setting the order of the days of the week.
- Codebase refactoring and testing.
